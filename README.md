CS 405 Secure Coding



  After completing multiple assignments and reading from this course, I now have a new mindset on security in the software development life cycle. I feel I had a more traditional mindset before not by purpose, but only because I hadn’t learned more about it yet. I am very interested in the Zero Trust mindset as this was a huge turning point for my security viewpoint. When simply focusing on a user’s location, I think it is amazing that this has completely changed the way we view security now days. I think the Covid pandemic had a huge part to play in the shift from the castle in moat mindset to the remote worker Zero Trust mindset. I like the newer viewpoint on security and am excited to implement it in my career. 
  I have always seen security as something to implement the entire software development lifecycle. I think it may take some people more time to implement this mindset, but I think it is important to make sure it is held in high regard at all companies and organizations. You never know when a breach in security is going to happen, and it will. We can prevent a lot, but we can 100% say that security will never be compromised. I hold the 10 security principles and standards in high regard, as well as, the principle of least privilege and defense in depth. All of these techniques are to be used in accordance with one another to all an entire SDLC security mindset. In the long run, when a breach of security has occurred, it comes with high costs. These can be company damaging, personally damaging, involve money, and involve data. Preventing breaches in the first place is the way to go. Being impatient and not implementing all security techniques is how mistakes happen. I think I have learned many new techniques to implement in my future career.
